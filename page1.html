            Khabib to Conor: "It is the same thing" It's the same thing as the
            previous fight. If it's a first round finish, I'd back Conor. From
            the second and further, then Dustin wins. The Russian - who retired
            in March with a record of 29-0 with eight knockouts - has submission
            victories over both McGregor and Poirier, so he knows a thing or two
            about their game plans and skillsets. He memorably scaled the
            Octagon at UFC 229 after defeating McGregor to attack his cornerman
            Dillon Danis, who had reportedly shouted insults at Khabib following
            the fight. The Russian has turned to promoting following his
            retirement and is mentoring fellow lightweight Islam Makhachev -
            currently ranked #9 in the UFC rankings.
